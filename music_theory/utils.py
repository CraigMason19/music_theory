"""
This module defines symbolic direction aliases for upward and downward movement
in musical space, and provides a utility to constrain arbitrary integer indices
to the musically meaningful range of Â±11 semitones. Values â‰¥12 are treated as
octave-equivalent and reduced modulo 12, preserving directional intent.

Constants:
    UP_DIRECTIONS:    Aliases for upward movement.
    DOWN_DIRECTIONS:  Aliases for downward movement.

Functions:
    index_to_range(index): 
        Normalizes an integer index to the range -11 to +11, preserving sign.
